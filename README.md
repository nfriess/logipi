# Code for Logipi FPGA board

This project contains various bits of code for the logpi board.
More information on the board can be found at

## Projects

- **audio_player**: A basic implementation to stream hifi
  audio from a host PC to a logipi that drives 8 D-to-As.

- **flash_loader**: A utility to load .bit files on the flash
  chip, or read data from the flash chip.

- **i2cslave**: An I2C slave device that can communicate with
  the Raspberry Pi, implementing a wishbone master in VHDL.

- **pi_audio_player**: Playing hifi audio from the Raspberry Pi,
  replacing the audio_player setup with C# and Ethernet.

- **spislave**: An SPI slave device that can communicate with
  the Raspberry Pi, implementing a wishbone master in VHDL.
